# Description 
This is one of my first solo projects made on Scrimba educational portal.
The website generates random passwords that are 15 characters long.

## What I learned
I got a solid understanding of how to manipulate arrays and use the for loop. 
I improved my understanding of how to work with the DOM
I had a lot of fun! 

## What I need to add
I need to add support for mobile browsers, it doesn't look nice on mobile.
I need to add an option to change the length of the passwords
I need to add an option to choose if you want letters, numbers or special chars in the password.
Add a text that you need to tap on the password to copy it
